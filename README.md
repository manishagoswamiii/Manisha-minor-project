Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The main goal of this project was to practice JavaScript logic and understand how JavaScript works with HTML elements.

How I built the game

I started by creating the basic structure of the game using HTML. 
The game board consists of nine clickable cells arranged in a 3×3 grid. 
I also added a message section to display the game result and a replay button to restart the game.

After that, I used CSS to design the layout. 
CSS grid was used to align the nine cells properly and to make the board look neat and readable. 
Basic styling was added to make the game simple and user friendly.

The main logic of the game is written in JavaScript. 
I used an array to store the current state of the board.
Each time a player clicks on a cell, JavaScript updates the board with either X or O.
After every move, the program checks all possible winning combinations.
If a player completes a winning pattern, a winning message is shown.
If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game displays a draw message.

Once the game is finished, no further moves are allowed.
The replay button clears the board and resets all values so that a new game can start.
